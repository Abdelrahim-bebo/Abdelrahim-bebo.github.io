  title: "About Me",
  content: `I started my career deep in the world of embedded systems, where precision and reliability were more than technical goals‚Äîthey were a passion. Over time, I realized the processes around building and deploying this software were often manual and slow, limiting what teams could achieve and introducing unnecessary risk. That realization became my catalyst for change.

Driven to make a broader impact, I stepped up as part of the engineering team and championed the adoption of DevOps practices. I was directly involved in introducing modern CI/CD pipelines and automation, helping the group shift from legacy manual deployments to fast, repeatable, and reliable workflows. This transformation wasn't just technical‚Äîit was cultural, requiring trust, training, and open collaboration.

Helping guide my team through this change, I ran hands-on demo sessions, wrote clear documentation, and always ensured we had safety nets‚Äîlike robust rollback plans‚Äîfor our new approaches. The result was a more agile, resilient, and empowered team, ready to take on challenges with confidence. My journey from embedded systems to DevOps taught me that innovation thrives at the intersection of curiosity and courage, and I bring this mindset to every project I join.`
